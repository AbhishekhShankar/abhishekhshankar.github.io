			<p> For those who may not know, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency 
				that was created by an unknown person or group of persons known only 
				as Satoshi Nakamoto that relies on encryption techniques to regulate 
				the generation of coins. We were given a dataset sourced from 
				<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" style="color: blue">Coinmarketcap</a> 
				which contained the daily closing prices of Bitcoin (in USD), from the 
				27/04/2013 to 03/03/2018 and were tasked with using R as a means for model 
				fitting and forecasting through time series analysis.

			<p>
				Financial data tends to contain high amounts of variation between the 
				current values in time to their past values. Given this, the conditional 
				variance structure of Bitcoin's time series data can be modelled by utilising 
				approaches that do not include ARIMA models considering their assumption of a 
				constant variance is not helpful in this scenario.
			</p>

			<p>
				Considering the main use of an ARCH (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastisity) 
				model is to predict future conditional variances, it is likely that it is useful 
				here. In fact, a GARCH (Generalised ARCH) model may be better considering it 
				allows us to obtain more efficient estimates by placing less weight on past squared 
				returns in order to account for more distant volatitilies in the future.
			</p>

		</div>

			<h2>INITIAL BITCOIN DATA INSPECTION</h2>

			<p> 
				The entirety of the R code can be found in the link at the top of the page, so there 
				won't be any code snippets on this page in order to prevent it from being overly long, 
				but the source code has been thoroughly commented to make up for this.
			</p>

			<img class="projectImageBTC" src="bitcoinImages/tsPlotInspection.JPG">
			<br>
			<p> 
				Plotting the Bitcoin dataset shows multiple trends and periods where volatitility is 
				both high and low which implies the existence of an ARCH effect. We can see from the 
				zoomed in portion of the plot that the data exhibits both autoregressive and moving 
				average behaviours. Also, there does not seem to be any sign of seasonality from the 
				plot. 
			</p>


			<img class="projectImageBTC" src="bitcoinImages/btcReturn.jpeg">
			<br>
			<p> 
				Looking at the return series, there does not seem to be any kind of trends in the data, 
				however, the volatility in the data is highlighted by the sudden spikes in the variance 
				that occur for short periods of time. This is characteristic of ARCH behaviour.
			</p>			
		

			<img class="projectImageBTC" src="bitcoinImages/returnDiagnostics.JPG">
			<br>
			<p>
				We can look at the diagnostics of the return series as a way to look deeper into the 
				data. The QQ plot displays tails which deviate from the line of normality and while 
				both the ACF and PACF plots show multiple significant correlations, the EACF plot 
				seems to suggest an ARMA(0, 0) model. 

				The results of the McLeod-Li test proved to be highly significant which corresponds 
				to the normality assumption being violated, and agrees with the results of the QQ plot.
			</p>
		</div>


		<div class="highlightBanner">
			<h2 class="highlightTitle">T H E O R Y</h2>
			
			<p>
				Considering that ARMA is a mean model while GARCH is a variance model, a combination 
				of an ARMA and a GARCH model may be ideal in this case. The GARCH model would be sufficient if we knew that 
				the time series has 0 mean, however that is not the case here and the mean needs to 
				be estimated. There are two ways that we can account for both the mean and the variance 
				in the data: 
				
				<li>Fit and subtract an ARMA model first so that only the residuals remain</li> 

				<li>Fit an ARMA + GARCH model simultaneously - which I believe is a more efficient method.</li>
			</p>
		</div>


		<div class="textBody">
			<h2>GARCH MODEL SPECIFICATION</h2>

			<p> 
				In order to determine the orders of the GARCH model, we first take the squared and 
				absolute values of the return series since the conditional variances in the GARCH 
				model are constrained to be non-negative.
			</p>

			<img class="projectImageBTC" src="bitcoinImages/sqAbsGarch.JPG">
			<br>

			<p> 
				There are multiple significant correlations in both the ACF and PACF of the squared 
				return series and since the vertex of the EACF can be taken at the position (2, 2), 
				the suggested model is no longer an ARMA(0, 0) model, but potentially from a list 
				including:
			</p>

			<p>
				<li style="text-align: center;">\( ARMA(2, 2) \)</li>
  				<li style="text-align: center;">\( ARMA(2, 3) \)</li>
  				<li style="text-align: center;">\( ARMA(3, 3) \)</li>
			</p>	

			<p>
				Similarly, the ACF and PACF of the absolute value return series shows many 
				signifiant correlations. The vertex of the EACF can be taken at the position (1, 1) 
				which corresponds the following potential models:
			</p>

			<p>
				<li style="text-align: center;">\(ARMA(1, 1) \)</li>
				<li style="text-align: center;">\(ARMA(1, 2) \)</li>
				<li style="text-align: center;">\(ARMA(2, 2) \)</li>
			</p>

			<p>
				On a separate proof it was shown that: \(GARCH(p, q) = ARMA(max(p, q), p) \)
			</p>

			<p>
				From this, the list of potential models can be considered to be:

				<li style="text-align: center;">\(ARMA(max(1, 1), 1) = GARCH(1, 1) \) </li>
				<li style="text-align: center;">\(ARMA(max(1, 2), 2) = GARCH(2, 2) \)</li>
				<li style="text-align: center;">\(ARMA(max(2, 2), 2) = GARCH(2, 2)\)</li>
				<li style="text-align: center;">\(ARMA(max(3, 3), 3) = GARCH(3, 3)\)</li>
			</p>
		</div>	


		<div class="textBody">

			<h2>GARCH MODEL FITTING AND ANALYSIS</h2>

			<p> 
				The R model summary for the \(GARCH(1, 1) \) model is shown below, while the 
				results of the other models can be seen in the report.
			</p>

			<img style="width: 50%;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"class="projectImageBTC2" 
			src="bitcoinImages/garch11summary.JPG">
			<br>

			<p> 
				The \( GARCH(1, 1) \) model resulted in all highly significant parameters. 
				Conversely, the \( GARCH(2, 2) \) model had an insignificant \(a_2 \) parameter, 
				while the \( GARCH(3, 3) \) resulted in insignificant \(a_2 \), \(b_1 \), and 
				\(b_3 \) parameters.
			</p>

			<p>
				An effective method to determine the ideal model to fit is the Akaike Information 
				Criterion (AIC) which is an estimator of the relative quality of the models 
				against each other.

				The results of the ranking indicated that the best model to fit is the 
				\( GARCH(1, 1) \) model and this aligns with the results of the model summary 
				which determined that it was the only model of the three that had all significant 
				parameters.

			</p>

			<br>
			<img class="projectImageBTC2" src="bitcoinImages/sortScoreGarch.JPG">
			<br>

			<p>
				A final comparison of models is a look into their residuals. It was observed that 
				every model that was fit had similar residuals.

				There does not seem to be a trend in the plot of the standardised residuals, which 
				are defined as: \(\epsilon = {r_t \over \Sigma_{t|t-1}} \) which are approximately 
				independent and identically distributed variables, indicating the potential for
				there to be randomness in the residuals which is a good thing for the model being fit. 
				Also, the Shapiro-Wilk test was highly significant for all models indicating non-normality 
				of residuals at a 5% level of significance.

				<img class="projectImageBTC" src="bitcoinImages/garch11residuals.jpeg">
				<br>
				
				Given that the residuals of each of the potential GARCH models do not differ 
				significantly, the results of the ranking of the AIC and parameter significance is 
				sufficient enough to conclude that the \( GARCH(1, 1) \) model is the ideal model 
				to fit to the data in order to account for the conditional variance in the dataset.
			</p>
		</div>	

		<div class="textBody">
			<h2>ARMA + GARCH MODEL SPECIFICATION</h2>

			<p> 
				A good way to determine which model is a nice fit for the data is to attempt to 
				overfit in both the autoregressive and moving average components. Should the overfitted 
				model show insignificant parameters then the model prior to overfitting is a good fit. 
				After obtaining a number of potential models, a number of information criteria tests can 
				be used as a ranking system. 
			</p>
			<img class="projectImageBTC" src="bitcoinImages/armaGarchList.JPG">
			<br>

			<p>
			<img class="projectImageBTC" src="bitcoinImages/finalRanking.JPG">
			<br>
			Using four different ranking criterias, the ideal model to fit to the data was the 
			\(ARMA(3, 2) + GARCH(1, 1) \).
			</p>

		</div>	

		<div class="textBody">
			<h2>FORECASTING AND MEAN ABSOLUTE STANDARD ERROR</h2>

			<p> 
				Even though the \(ARMA(3, 2) + GARCH(1, 1) \) model was ranked as the best of the 
				three candidate models, all three models were used to forecast separately and compared. 
				Forecasting was completed for \(h=10 \) steps ahead where each step represents one day. 
				The accuracy of the models and forecasts were done using the mean absolute standard error 
				(MASE) which compares the theoretical values calculated through the model and compares 
				them to the actual values shown in the dataset. A value of 0 indicates that the fitted 
				model is exactly as the data is, while the larger the MASE value, the larger the 
				divergence from reality.
			</p>

			<p>
				<img class="projectImageBTC" src="bitcoinImages/garch11forecastplot.jpeg">
			<br>

				According to the MASE, the most accurately fit model both terms of model fitting to the 
				data and forecasting was the \(ARMA(2, 1) + GARCH(1, 1) \) model. The plot of the forecasts 
				is shown above, while the MASE values for the fitted model is shown below and the forecasted 
				model results are shown below that.
			</p>

			<p>
				<img class="projectImageBTC3" style="width: 35%;" src="bitcoinImages/maseRanking.JPG">
			<br>

				<img class="projectImageBTC3" style="width: 35%;" src="bitcoinImages/forecastRanking.JPG">
			</p>

			<p>
				While the ideal model according to the model fitting and overfitting process did not agree 
				with the actual results of the fit and forecast, the differences in the accuracy of the 
				models according to the MASE do tend to be very small. 
			</p>

			
		</div>	


		<div class="textBody">
			<h2>FINAL THOUGHTS</h2>

			<p> 
				Achieving MASE scores close to 0 and below 1 would have been a nice finish to this 
				project, however that was not the case here. Thinking about it a little deeper however, 
				while financial data is volatile, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency data is even more 
				volatile considering people's views regarding it's worth fluctuates and that their 
				smaller market sizes when compared to established currencies can result in large 
				affects on the price from small movements in the market.
			</p>

			<p>
				The goal of this project was to be able to fit a model to the data accuractely and 
				forecast accurately as well. Finding some compromise between the two aspects of the 
				analysis required us to accept that our accuracy between the two components is 
				slightly sacrificed in order to achieve a model that is well rounded in terms of 
				its model fitting and its forecasting and we believe we did that.
